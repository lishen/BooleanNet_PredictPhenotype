Number of nodes in the network has to be specified during compilation. 
Predicted network has 8 nodes and curated network has 29 nodes.

Compile:
g++ -O3 -DNODES=8 boolfix.cpp -o boolfix_8

boolfix_8 is executable. Any network with 8 nodes can be used with this.

The edge filename, the node property filename and output file name  must be specified as follows:

./boolfix_8 sporulation_edge.txt sporulation_node.txt sporulation

The format of sporulation_edge.txt file is as follows:
parent_node_name \tab child_node_name \tab activating/repressing_edge(+/-)

The format of sporulation_node.txt file is:
node_name \tab is_selfdegraded (y/n) \tab is_AND_node(y/n) \tab clamp_value(0/1/-1)

hetero-dimer formation is modeled as AND node. If a node is AND node, then it receives
input 1 if and only if all its parents take value 1. If a node's clamped value is -1, then
it is not clamped.

There are two output files:
sporulation_matrix.txt and sporulation_fixedpoints.txt. The former is just connectivity matrix of sporulation network and the latter is the list of fixedpoints and the corresponding 
basin sizes. 

For the curated network, just do the same:

Compile:
g++ -O3 -DNODES=29 boolfix.cpp -o boolfix_29

boolfix_29 is executable. Any network with 29 nodes can be used with this.

./boolfix_29 spor_edge.txt spor_node.txt spor
